## Introduction
In this assignment, our primary objective is to ascertain the angular position of a target by the received signal at array antenna as shown in the figure below:

This involves each component transmitting a radar signal and capturing the reflected echo from the intended target. 
Through the analysis of these received echoes, we can precisely determine the angular location of the target.


## Requirements

- MATLAB (tested with version R2023a)
